experiments performed with the nao robot

## NAO Robot Python SDK Installation Guide 

We used the following setup for programming our robot: 

1. Connect the PC and robot to the same (wireless) network. This is required because only then we can connect to the robot using itâ€™s IP address.   

2. Use the official Python SDK available in the softbanks robotics site 

 
## Windows 

1. Download the correct SDK file from the downloads page. 

2. Create a python2.7 environment. 

3. Copy the folder downloaded from 1 and paste into the environment folder/Lib/ 

4. Create an environment variable with the following: 
```PYTHONPATH=environment folder/Lib/SDK_Folder/lib/ ```

5. Open Python from the environment created in step 2. 
```python
import naoqi 
```
 

## Mac or Linux 

1. Only the python2.7.10 downloaded from python.org works, so we downloaded that. 

2. Add environment variable with the following: 
```bash
$ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:path_to_sdk/lib/python2.7/site-packages 

$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:~/Downloads/pynaoqi/lib 

$ export QI_SDK_PREFIX=~/Downloads/pynaoqi 
```
3. Open Python2.7.10
```bash
import naoqi
```
